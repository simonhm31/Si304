Hi I am a new programmer who is trying to solve the millenium prize problems. I will spend the prize money on lottery tickets. It shouldn't be too hard right - just a couple lines of Python. I'm looking forward to 
receiving millions of dollars for my work although I will probably turn down the money like Gregori Perelman because I'm very selfless and kind.
